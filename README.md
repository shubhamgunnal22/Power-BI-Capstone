# Power-BI-Capstone
As part of the ShopNest Store Capstone project, I designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze key business analytics for a retail dataset. The project focused on nine datasets covering various aspects of the business, including customer information, geolocation, orders, payments, reviews, products, sellers, and product categories.

The tasks involved in the project included:

1. Top Categories by Total Price: Identified and visually represented the top 10 product categories by total sales.

2. Delayed Orders Analysis: Determined the number of delayed orders in each category by comparing actual delivery dates with estimated delivery dates.

3. Monthly Comparison of Delayed and On-Time Orders: Created dynamic visuals comparing delayed and on-time orders for each month, utilizing the drillthrough cross-report feature for detailed analysis.

8. Revenue Analysis: Determined the total revenue generated by ShopNest Store and analyzed how it changed over time on a yearly basis, using suitable visuals to highlight trends and patterns.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design, providing valuable insights into sales performance, order management, customer behavior, and revenue trends for ShopNest Store in the e-commerce market in Portugal.
